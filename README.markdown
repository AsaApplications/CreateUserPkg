CreateUserPkg
=============

This utility creates packages that create local user accounts when installed. The packages can create users on 10.5-10.8, and they are compatible with all workflows that can install standard installer pkgs. For the details on how the packages work, see Greg Neagle's article in the [May 2012 issue of MacTech](http://www.mactech.com/issue-TOCs-2012).
